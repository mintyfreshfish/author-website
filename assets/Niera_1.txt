Dear Zephyra,
I hope this letter finds you. I checked every book I can and haven't found any mention of Ravens Port. Sarah insists that she knows where it is, but… I guess if I get a letter back I'll know for sure. I'll also know never to play any sort of geography game against Sarah. It's best to avoid playing Sarah in any sort of trivia game, but you don't have to worry about that.
I wanted to thank you and apologize. Sarah said you spent a lot of time with me while you were here, and I'm sorry I was rude. I'm not usually so… mean. I'm sure you heard the story behind it all, and I'd rather not write it out.
I also wanted to thank you for being kind to me. You had no reason to be, and you could have easily taken advantage of the situation. You are definitely kinder than I will ever be.
My guess is that Anna forced you to leave somehow. She is the cause of everything horrible, and the things people are saying about you and Davian are pretty horrible. I struggle to believe you came to Falsk on an assassination contract. Framing you seems like something Anna would do. Probably another diabolical plot designed to ruin every life except her own. Sarah didn't say I was wrong when I brought it up, which is essentially an affirmation. It's probably good you got away. Anna is as evil as they come. She belongs with all the monsters you taken down. I hope someone else outsmarts her someday and she can get what she deserves. Not sure if there's a punishment big enough for her at this point. Hanging would be too kind.
I hope you return to Ravens Port, and that this letter gets there as well. I guess you could be anywhere, but I didn't want to wait on sending you a letter – writing is a nice distraction from my own misery.
With love,
