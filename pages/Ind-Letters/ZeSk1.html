      <p>
        I&#8216;m writing to let you know I made it back safely to Raven&#8216;s Port, as promised. I got back late last night, and Davian left this morning for who knows where. Don&#8216;t worry. He was very civil the whole way, and I kept my distance. Not even a scratch. Well, not from him at least. I have a few minor injuries from other things, but nothing serious. Don&#8216;t worry. They&#8216;ll heal quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        How is the tour? How is Littenby? I still wish I could see it. It sounds wonderful, and I thought about it a lot on my journey. <img src="../../assets/scribble.png" height="30px;"> I thought about you too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Funny, it took me almost my whole way here to convince myself I was going home and not leaving it. But I think I finally realized something on my way back. You kept asking why I would give up my family to stay there with you, and I consistently insisted I didn&#8216;t have any. And technically I don&#8216;t. But you were right. You were right about a lot of things, but especially this. I do have family here. Rosamund, Berg, Ravvi, the Siren Huntress even&#8212;they are my family. And maybe I need to accept that now, and I need to accept that this is home. It&#8216;s not what I wanted or what has always been my ideal, but it&#8216;s what I have. And maybe that can be okay. Maybe I can be happy here too. I&#8216;m going to try. Maybe your wish for me will come true after all. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I probably shouldn&#8216;t say this. I&#8216;m probably just making things infinitely worse, but I can&#8216;t not tell you. You will always be all those things to me too. I think a piece of my heart will always be in Falsk with you. I don&#8216;t think I&#8216;ll ever not wonder what our life would have been together. I&#8216;ll probably have moments years to come where I think about what would be happening at that point if I had stayed&#8212;whether we&#8216;d still be traveling, what we would be doing to help each city, whether we&#8216;d maybe be our own family by then. Or maybe everything would have fallen apart and we&#8216;d hate eachother, but I don&#8216;t think wishful daydreams tend to focus on those kinds of possibilities. And I don&#8216;t think that would have happened anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is, even though things change and we both have to move on now, know I&#8216;ll always care about you. That will never change. I&#8216;ll always want your happiness, I&#8216;ll always want your success, and I&#8216;ll always want to know you&#8216;re okay. So if it&#8216;s not too hard, please keep in touch. I want to know all the wonderful things you do, even if I have to celebrate them from afar. And I hope someday you find someone who can celebrate them there with you. She will be an incredibly fortunate woman. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, enough of that. Rosamund and Berg are arguing about something down the hall, so I should probably go see what that&#8216;s all about. And I want to make sure this letter gets sent with the next caravan. If you don&#8216;t want to write back, that&#8216;s okay. I understand. But I&#8216;ll probably keep sending you letters until you tell me to stop. I think you were spared the brunt of it while we were together, but I can be very persistent when it comes to things like that, so unless I hear from you otherwise, they&#8216;ll keep coming. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this letter finds you well. I&#8216;m sure you are bringing joy to everyone you&#8216;re playing for. They are lucky to experience all that you share when you play. I wish everyone here could have that experience too. <s>Especially me</s>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope today is a good day. 
      </p>

<!---->    <p class="ps">PS&#8212;I probably shouldn&#8216;t write to you in Falsk under my actual name. I don&#8216;t want to cause any trouble for you if anyone sees letters from me, seeing as I&#8216;m sure I&#8216;m a wanted criminal now. And I know how fast word gets around about these things. If you see a letter from Rosamund Riglietti, know it&#8216;s from me. I&#8216;m hoping this letter won&#8216;t be a problem since I&#8216;m sending it to Littenby. I seem to remember you saying people weren&#8216;t quite as concerned about these things there. </p>
