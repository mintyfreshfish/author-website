      <p>
        Or do you prefer Ottilie? I didn’t even know Niera wasn’t your first name. Both are beautiful. You’ll have to let me know which one I should use in the future.
      </p>

        It’s so wonderful to hear from you!  I hope you don’t mind I used a different name on the outside of this letter. I was guessing the name “Zephyra” might get you in some sort of trouble. Just know any letter from Rosamund Riglietti is actually from me. Hopefully that saves you from any kind of scandal. It sounds like Davian and I are being pegged with all sorts of terrible things. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your thinking so well of me and not believing them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m so glad you’re feeling well enough to write! One of the things I regret most about having to leave is not being there for you as you heal. And that we won’t be able to be friends. Though I suppose we still can through letters! Maybe someday I’ll be able to come back and we can be friends in person. Though I probably shouldn’t get my hopes up. It’s hard not to sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please keep me updated on how you are and what is going on in your life. I want to know everything happening in Falsk and with you. And I want to know more about you too! Aside from your wonderful memory and kind heart, I don’t know much yet. So tell me more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will try and send a map from Raven’s Port to Falsk next time I write. It might take me a little while to find one. Things are busier here than I expected, but I know a few people who might have one. Then you can see exactly where I’ve disappeared to. And maybe beat Sura in a little geography trivia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should probably finish this letter and head back upstairs. A friend from my younger days is here recovering from--well, being cursed, if I’m being honest. You know about magic here, so I can say that. But it’s my turn to sit with him. Which is complicated in and of itself, but I’ll explain that some other time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ll try and write again soon. Hopefully letters make it back and forth faster than people do. I look forward to hearing from you when you have a chance. You have to tell me how everyone is doing. Sura, Torin, Skeigi--especially Skeigi. If you see him--well, please just let me know how he is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you again for your letter. It means more than you know. I look forward to hearing from you again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope today is a good day.
