<!---->    <p class="greeting">Davian,</p>
<!---->    <p class="letterBody">
      <p>I&#39m glad to hear you escaped Falsk without incident. You gave Freir quite the story to write. I hope you&#39re okay with a few embellishments, he&#39s a reporter, after all, and he sometimes can&#39t help himself. You&#39ve probably already found the article that came with this letter. Congratulations, you&#39re famous for the next week or so. Other people would kill for that kind of publicity. In a way, you&#39ve done just that.</p>
      <p>Sadly, I have also recovered. I&#39m sure you were happy to see me die, but I&#39m not kind enough to give you the satisfaction. Freir has been a perfect gentleman since my coming homeâ€”he&#39s far better than you ever were.</p>
      <p>Alas, this letter is not simply for pleasantries. I hope you never thought you were special enough to me to merit a personal letter. I&#39d have completely forgotten you already except that you have information I want. I don&#39t care enough to not write you out of spite, so here we are.</p>
      <p>I lead you on a number of wild goose chases to find your precious gold orb. One of the people you talked to was a man named Selos Reykspor. I believe it was the second day you were here, but, seeing as I didn&#39t sleep the four days you were in Falsk, I don&#39t remember exactly. I was caught up in a number of other things at the time, and forgot to ask what he said to you.</p>
      <p>I&#39m eager to see Selos rot in prison for some personal injustices he&#39s committed against me. A hanging would be too quick a death. Starvation is more fitting. I&#39ll have him beg for his life, then his death, and I&#39ll give him neither.</p>
      <p> Enclosed you&#39ll find fifty gold pieces. That&#39s a promise. If you give me information about Selos, I&#39ll give you another hundred. If you give me something I can use to destroy him, I may slip and add an extra zero.</p>
    </p>
<!---->    <p class="goodbye">Enjoy brutishly killing things,</p>
