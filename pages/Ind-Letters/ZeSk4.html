      <p>
<p>I can’t even tell you how happy I am to get your letter. Letters, actually. And all the music. I cannot wait to see if I can find a way to play it. There aren’t any pianos in Raven’s Port, but I can try to pick out the notes on the lute for now.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I’m sending you a lute. As soon as I finish this letter, I’m heading out to find you one--a good one. It’ll be sent with this letter. It might take a few extra days to get to you because of it, but hopefully it’ll be worth it. I’ve written down a few more spell songs. Maybe there will be explosions with these.  You’ll have to let me know. Though I don’t want to hurt your piano, so maybe it’s best if there aren’t any. That would be far more than just a good tuning. </p>
<p>I’m working on another song too. You told me so many times I had a lot of things to say and that I should let out that I’ve kept hidden for so long. I’ve thought about that a lot. I had three long weeks of lonely travel to think about that a lot. Maybe you’re right. You were right about a lot of other things, so I wouldn’t be surprised. This song might take me a while, as I can only work on it for short periods of time, but I promise I’ll finish it. And when I do, I’ll send it to you. Maybe you can write more music to go with it, like you did for this one. We can keep composing together even though we’re hundreds of miles away. </p>
<p>How much more of the tour do you have left?  Where are you right now? I keep sending these to Littenby, and it sounds like they’re finding you. But let me know if I need to start sending them elsewhere. The city with the river running through it--are there ducks in the river? And a bridge with spherical lanterns on either end that glow amber at dusk? I saw that one in one of my visions. It was a beautiful city, and I wish I could have seen it in person. That’s probably all I should say about it. I want to say more, but I won’t. There’s so much I want to say. </p>
<p>I love the picture of the fountain. Thank you for it. I’m going to have it framed and put it up in my room somewhere. It will remind me to be happy. I’m trying. I really am. Things are hard here. I know I have Rosamund and Berg, and they’re my family. But I’m just...lonely, I guess. Ravvi is still terrified of me, and they spend most of their time with him, as they should. I try and support him too, but it’s not easy when I just cause him more pain instead of actually helping. It’s not a pleasant feeling. But I am trying to be happy. Writing music makes me happy. Reading your letters made me happy. I’m trying to make your wish for me come true.</p>
<p>I hope you are happy though. Things sound like they are...hard. I wish they weren’t. I wish more than anything I could be there to help and to support you through what you’re dealing with. Even though selfishly I really don’t want it to, I still hope my wish for you comes true. I can’t be there to support you right now, not in person. But I really hope you find someone who can. I desperately want you to be happy and loved. More than anything else. </p>
<p>Anyway, I want to know more about what you’re doing. I wish I could read your thoughts from this far too. Wouldn’t that be nice? I’ll have to work on my magic. I’m actually very average at it, if not below average. Maybe with some practice I could find a way to do it. Might take a few years though. I’ll keep you updated. But in the meantime, please keep writing. I want to know how you’re doing. Even if it takes you a month to write again, or even if the letters are short. And I don’t hate you. I very much don’t hate you. Very much. Hopefully my letters aren’t getting annoying for you. There have been quite a few of them. </p>
<p>I hope today is a good one, and that you enjoy the lute. Hopefully you can find time to try it. If you can’t, that’s okay too. I know you’re busy. I miss you too.</p>
      </p>
<p class="goodbye">Much Love,</p> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->

<p class="ps" hidden>PS&#8212;I probably shouldn&#8216;t write to you in Falsk under my actual name. I don&#8216;t want to cause any trouble for you if anyone sees letters from me, seeing as I&#8216;m sure I&#8216;m a wanted criminal now. And I know how fast word gets around about these things. If you see a letter from Rosamund Riglietti, know it&#8216;s from me. I&#8216;m hoping this letter won&#8216;t be a problem since I&#8216;m sending it to Littenby. I seem to remember you saying people weren&#8216;t quite as concerned about these things there. </p>   <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
