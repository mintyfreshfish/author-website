<p class="greeting">Dear Zephyra,</p> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
<p class="letterBody"> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
<p>I was heartbroken to read your last letter. Heartbroken! I don’t know how magic works, but I assume it’s well within the realm of possibility to be able to see the future, or, a future? I’m glad I got to be there, even if they were only visions. It gives me hope. So, thanks for that.</p>
<p>But the memories. That must be torture. I can’t imagine how miserable that must be, but I think you made the right choice. I hope so. I wish you could be happier about it. Life can sometimes be so… cruel. Maybe, with time, it will get better? That’s what Sura tells me, and she is usually right.</p>
<p>I keep having to remember that you don’t know me that well. I always assume you know all the craziness that is my life, but then I realize I should probably explain it to you. This is my long way of saying that I might understand a tiny bit of what you’re feeling. This might not be what you want to read right now, so I don’t blame you at all if you don’t. Some people like to be alone in their pain, so I don’t want to intrude.</p>
<p>I think in my last letter I told you what a horrible person I am. It’s not just that, though. Maybe it’s all caused by the same thing, but I also have the horrible talent of falling in love too soon. I have found my Skeigi a countless number of times, except they all end up being self-absorbed jerks. I loved them, though. I would have married each and every one of them. Maybe I’ve read too many books, but I feel those stereotypical things every time — my heart gets ripped out, the world loses its color, all of that sappy stuff. I make fun of it now, but I think that’s only because I’ve been single for over a month now. I don’t think that’s happened since I was 15.</p>
<p>It usually goes as follows:</p>
<p>1. Sura (usually just Aenna’s messenger) tells me I have to distract someone, or convince someone of something, or really have any benign interaction with a man.</p>
<p>2. This man always ends up being ridiculously handsome. I don’t know why Sura never asks me to talk to ugly people. I always end up having to fake-flirt with drop dead gorgeous men. Although, I was looking through pictures while writing this letter, and maybe I was just drunk.</p>
<p>3. I flirt, he flirts, and I start to believe he actually likes me. This takes around five minutes. All they have to do is smile and say my name and I’m gone. This is not something I’m proud of, but I’ve had to come to terms with it.</p>
<p>4. I may be a 3rd child, but I still have money and an important last name. It’s not hard to convince people to date me. Half the time, they just want to use me for something or steal my money. I don’t think anyone has sincerely liked me. </p>
<p>5. By the next morning, I’m seriously in love. If Sura hadn’t scared them all away, then I would have gotten married at 16 ½, or any month after that. I would have died for several men after only a couple days of knowing them. I almost have.</p>
<p>6. I’m so far gone, there’s nothing Sura can do. She’s probably wanted to strangle me several hundred times, and she’s probably had to stop Aenna from doing so at least several times. It takes anywhere from two weeks to a month for the new love of my life to dump me. I am not a nice person to be around, and it doesn’t take long for people to see that my craziness is not an act. I don’t blame them for running.</p>
<p>7. I decide that life has lost all meaning. When it happens, I’m only a little better than how I was when you met me. Usually, though, I lock myself in my house and nobody else has to deal with it. Now that I write it, I see that it was stupid of me to imply that I know how you feel. You have something real. I never did, but at the time, I felt that each of those men were my other half. I never had magic visions, but I certainly made my own.</p>
<p>I wish I could help you instead of writing a useless letter that probably only made you feel worse. I hope things get better for you. Maybe Rosamund and Berg know how to help you heal. I wish I could give you news about Skeigi, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen him except on his posters. Those kinds of concerts have never been my thing. Maybe it’s the sitting down for two hours straight. I’m not patient enough to count the swords in the barracks, so there’s no way I could make it through a Skeigi concert. I’ll keep my ears open, but you should probably find another source of information about him.</p>
<p>I’ve almost thrown this letter away so many times, so I’ll write a funny story so I can convince myself you won’t hate it.</p>
<p>Remember Idin from last letter? He is not terrible. He definitely could have been a lot worse while I was at the barracks, but he still annoyingly casual with me. This story is not about him, but about his friend.</p>
<p>The last day I was there before I had to go back to the office, the whole place was in complete chaos. I stole my way through the front office because I could hear things going on. In the middle of the main sparring ring was a huge peacock. I don’t know how he got a hold of it, but Aalder somehow smuggled it in, and let it loose without anyone catching him.</p>
<p>Everyone knew he had done it. Nobody else would have. She must have planned it for when I was there so that I could make sure he didn’t get fired. I included a feather with this letter as proof.</p>
<p>We could hardly get anything done the entire day. Even after they wrangled the bird, they didn’t have anywhere to put it. They couldn’t let it loose on the streets – it had to belong to somebody. I don’t know what they ended up doing with it. I was a little distracted because Aalder found me laughing and confessed to the whole thing. I think he told me how he did it, but I had to focus on not kissing him. He is so amazing, and I wish you could meet him, but you can’t write Sura about any of this. She will keep me from leaving this house forever, and I’ll die a slow and horrible death as I suffocate in her tiny rooms. </p>
<p>Seriously, Aalder is different than all the other ones. We genuinely like each other, which is helped by the fact that he is practically perfect. We will never happen, though. I’m rich, and he’s not, and he’ll never have the courage to ask me out. I’ll just have to deal with it.</p>
<p>That’s my funny story, and I hope it makes things better for a little while. Hang in there.</p>
</p>
