<p>My friend Elia (that’s what she asked me to call her) cannot thank you enough for the fabric and the pattern! I saw it as well, and it is exquisite. I wish you could have seen her pure delight when she opened it. I went with her to the dressmaker, and Elia expressly told her she wasn’t allowed to alter the pattern in any way, no matter how much it might differ from styles in Raven’s Port. She cannot wait to wear it. It will be done in a few days, and I’ll have to send another letter and tell you how beautiful it is on Elia. She’ll probably want to wear it every day. </p>
<p>She is so glad to hear Niera is doing well. I think I’ve seen a letter or two from Niera sitting on her desk. Niera sounds like a wonderful person who has been through a lot, and I wish she had more people in her life who saw that. I know Elia does, and based on the way she talks about Niera, I do too. She has a friend in both of us. As do you.</p>
<p>Elia is anxious to hear news of everyone else in Falsk. She wants to know first of all how you are. Are you doing alright? She says you have a lot on your plate and wants you to know you can use your letters to her to talk about any of it, if you want to. No one else will ever read them, and she’s hundreds of miles away. If you need someone to support you from afar, you have us here in Raven’s Port. </p>
<p>How are Torin and Vurmira? What ended up happening with them at the party? Is there an alliance? She wasn’t sure if that was the correct phrasing, so she asks you to excuse her ignorance. The way she talks about it all sounds very exciting.</p>
<p>The package with this letter contains a new tea, since you enjoyed the last one so much. This one is a little different (some say an acquired taste), so you’ll have to give your honest opinion so she can better choose what to send. </p>
<p>Elia sends all her love and hopes you have a good day. She wishes she could be there to help. </p>
<p>We both hope to hear from you soon.</p>
</p>
<p class="goodbye">Much Love,</p> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
