<p class="greeting">Davian,</p> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
<p class="letterBody"> <!--//#region[update]--> <!--//#endregion-->
    <p>Thank you for writing back. It must have been so difficult for you, seeing that you want to be rid of me. I feel honored to be one of the select few that you deign to think about, and I always strive to be worth your attention. To be compared to someone as respectable as Zephyra? That is just too much. Freir had to revive me from a fainting spell after I read those words. What would I do without your letters to keep me going? As you might expect, I would rather stab myself in the heart than lose your affections. You should see the walls of my room. They are plastered with your letters so I can better read them nightly.</p>
    <p>Feel free to kill all the messengers you want. I have more, and, as your body count goes up, I won’t need a bounty to convince people to hunt you down. Wait, I forgot, I obviously want you alive. I’ll be sure to cry when I leave your head out to rot. Thank you for the reminder.</p>
    <p>Tell Zephyra hi for me. I miss making a fool out of her. She was so delightful to make cry, though, from what I’ve heard, I can hardly beat your record. What does she see in you? Perhaps she loves the rotting stench you carry around with you everywhere, or maybe your pathetic attempt at intelligence. How could she not love your primitive excuse for a life? Don’t think that you are fooling her. She must feel sorry for you, or thinks she can change you. Enjoy the compassion — even if it comes from someone only marginally smarter than you.</p>
    <p>I have no gifts for you this time. This letter is all you get. I have a life to worry about, and the mud on my shoe is more important to me than our correspondence. Feel free to be rid of me forever, but if you decide to spite me by sharing some things that you know, you can trust that it will be the last thing you ever say. I hope you haven’t mistaken my toying with you as an actual show of my power.</p>
