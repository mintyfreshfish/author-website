        <p>there’s a song that keeps repeating. I guess that’s not unusual, but this one is especially… Annoying? No, that’s not the right word. I don’t know, hopefully you know what I mean.</p>

          <p>For some reason, I didn’t think you would write. Now that I’m looking at your letter, it seems ridiculous. I wish you could hear my thoughts from where you are, because I can’t get the right words to come out. I never was much of a writer.</p>
          <p><s>You are</s></p>
          <p>You probably hate me by now. I can’t even get one good letter. Every time I think of you, I hear your song, and I get stuck. I’m sorry. I wish I was better.</p>

          <p>Why are days so long? Even when I’m practicing, I can’t get through them fast enough.</p>
          <p>I like the song… Love the song? Appreciate the song? You did well with the transcription. I have a few ideas, but I’ll have to buy a lute first. I tried to read up on them, but I could only get through a paragraph, and by the time I came back, I couldn’t remember where I put the book.</p>
          <p>I guess you saw the best of me in Falsk. <s>I’m not usually</s></p>
          <p>I draw worse than I write, but I got someone to sketch one of the fountains here. I dropped a coin in it today. I hope you’re happy — I’m not trying to be sarcastic. I really hope you’re happy. If you are, then I’ll have to believe in wishing fountains. That didn’t come out the way I wanted it to.</p>
          <p>The city here has a river running through the center of it. If I stand close enough, I can sometimes get my thoughts to quiet down. I’m standing next to it now, and I’m hoping to get an entire paragraph. However, now I can’t think of anything to write. Maybe my thoughts need to be louder after all.</p>

          <p>I’ve put this letter on the piano stand so that I can play a bit and stay focused. It looks like I’ve tried to send several letters before this one. I found them sticking out of books, and in music margins. I guess I’m not very good at this.</p>
          <p>Elementary, but not unsophisticated. I don’t mean that in a bad way. I hope you can see through the mess that is my writing. I can only write so fast. I started writing on one page, and then transcribing it to this one to hopefully avoid confusion, but I don’t think that’s working very well either. You should see all the scratched out half sentences that I can’t finish because I don’t know what I was thinking at the time. I hope that’s funny to you. I mean it to be.</p>
          <p>Elementary… I was going somewhere with that. Elementary isn’t bad. I wish I had more time to play things that were more elementary. Music like that doesn’t have the annoying fluff that sometimes bog down symphonies. I still like symphonies. They are my fourth favorite type of ensemble. Orchestras, I mean. A symphony is written for an orchestra, but sometimes the orchestra is called a Symphony Orchestra. I guess we just go by context.</p>
          <p>Sophisticated. I’m getting there. I don’t think your song is unsophisticated. I don’t really know what an unsophisticated song would be. It all depends on some arbitrary societal rules. I have a book on that, but if I stand up to go get it, I’m not sure I’ll come back.</p>
          <p>What I’m trying to say, is that I liked your song. Someone heard me hum it the other day. Today, maybe? They asked me what it was, and I said it was the work of an up-and-coming composer. Hopefully, I was right.</p>
          <p>No magic on my end either. Is it bad that I was hoping something would blow up? I tried my best, but maybe my piano is out of tune. It’s not. That was a joke. Out of tune pianos give me the worst headaches. I’ve started hiring a tuner to prep the piano before a concert cycle. Hopefully that’s not too pretentious.</p>
          <p>What else? I’m on a roll. If I play with my left hand, I can write pretty well, except sometimes the music I’m playing still gets too interesting. Not that you’re not interesting. You are interesting, and amazing, and a little like 7th diminished resolving to a… No, that only works in a certain circumstance. I can’t remember what I was thinking about.</p>
          <p>I thought I finished this letter, but apparently I didn’t. I’m sending everything I forgot to send over the past months. I hope you’re not too mad at me. Things are going a little better now. I hope they’re going well for you too. Good luck sorting through all the music. I’ve gotten a bit messy, and I accidentally wrote in shorthand, so sorry about that. I’ll try to write music clearer in the future. Right now, I’m going to send this letter before I forget again. Please don’t hate me. I promise I’m trying, and I wish I was better.</p>
