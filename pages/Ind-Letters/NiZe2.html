<!---->    <p class="greeting">Dear Zephyra,</p>
<!---->    <p class="letterBody">
      <p>I&#8216;m glad my letter made it. Even if it was addressed to the right place, I wasn&#8216;t sure it would actually make the entire journey. Hopefully, it was still sealed. As soon as I sent it out, I realized I probably should have been a bit more careful, and then I decided my reputation couldn&#8216;t get any worse, so it was fine. My secret isn&#8216;t out completely (I guess Aenna is still “saving” me from the publicity), but Sura says there are rumors, so that&#8216;s pretty much the end of me.</p>
      <p>Ottilie is technically my first name, and my mother&#8216;s middle name, but I started going by Niera after she died. It was when I was really young, so don&#8216;t feel bad. I remember she had dark hair, but that&#8216;s about it, and that might just be because I&#8216;ve seen pictures.</p>
      <p>Sura told me a long time ago that I still had to sign Ottilie on official documents, but I&#8216;m pretty sure that&#8216;s bull. It was the signature I practiced, though, and signatures are kind of a big deal here.</p>
      <p>It was the ancient seer Isilmara who said that a name holds a shadow of a soul. There&#8216;s a number of different translations on that one, but they&#8216;re all wrong. I don&#8216;t know how things are in Ravens Port, but I&#8216;ve about decided that all of Vothkar has been cursed with terrible historians. I know it&#8216;s irrational (which shouldn&#8216;t be surprising coming from me), but I still haven&#8216;t forgiven my mother for dying and leaving me with Aenna. I know she didn&#8216;t have a choice, but…as I said: irrational. Every time I sign my name, I try to think better of her. So far, it hasn&#8216;t worked.</p>
      <p>You made the papers for about a week, but I think the guard ran out of things to accuse you of. It got funny by the end. Davian ended up the leader of an underground crime ring, and you were a jewel thief, among other things. I know how these things go. Despite what people like to say, newspapers are for entertainment purposes only, and it wasn&#8216;t hard to see that the media was lying about you. However, if you were somehow a part of Aenna getting her throat slit, you should have finished the job. It would have saved Falsk a lot of trouble. Plus, it feels right that she would be murdered. It&#8216;s appropriately dramatic.</p>
      <p>Sorry. I should probably try to be nicer, but it&#8216;s hard when your sister is a literal demon. You met her, so you understand.</p>
      <p>You&#8216;re glad you left when you did. I may have been annoying before, but at least you could leave the room. Now I&#8216;m a walking monster ready to strike. It&#8216;s taken me four sittings to get this far in the letter because I can&#8216;t sit still, or I freak out. It&#8216;s the tiniest stuff: I once yelled at Sura for twenty minutes because she put flowers in my room without asking. I don&#8216;t know why she puts up with me. I wish I was better, and I really try to be nice, but it&#8216;s hard. The whole drug thing started because it was the only way to calm down and stay calm for long periods of time. I can admit now that it got out of hand, but my motives were pure. Now I don&#8216;t have anything.</p>
      <p>I still live at Sura&#8216;s house. She doesn&#8216;t trust me, but somehow hasn&#8216;t lost all patience with my…episodes. We don&#8216;t talk much anymore. She&#8216;s at work most of the day, so it took me a while to notice the silence. I don&#8216;t know how she lives in her house. It&#8216;s cramped and all the furniture is too nice. I feel bad sitting on the couch, and I don&#8216;t dare eat in my room in case I spill and ruin something expensive. You never saw my house, but I think you would&#8216;ve liked it. You never have to worry about breaking anything, because everything is already half-broken. Sura calls my living room the furniture graveyard, but I love it. There aren&#8216;t as many stairs, either, which is an added benefit, and everything is more spacious. I may hate being alone, but I enjoy having my own space without Sura constantly looking over my shoulder.</p>
      <p>I&#8216;ve been going to work again, which is nice. I hate work, but it&#8216;s better than doing nothing…at least, that&#8216;s what I thought it would be. A lot of my job is boring tables, charts and general pencil pushing, but every month I get to visit the guard and log estimates for how much things are worth. Sura could no-doubt tell you the importance of this activity, but I don&#8216;t care. It took a couple years, but I finally got the guard to stop treating me like someone important. We hang out for a week, I write some random numbers on the form I&#8216;m supposed to fill out, and then I have to wait another month before I can do it again. Lots of them shamelessly flirt with me, which I don&#8216;t mind, and I&#8216;ve convinced the captains to switch off giving me sword-fighting lessons. Before you think I&#8216;m any good, I&#8216;ll inform you that I can hold a rapier correctly, and that&#8216;s about it.</p>
      <p>This week has been one terrible day after the other. Idin is there. I must have not recognized him before, but now he seems to be everywhere, and I think he&#8216;s the one teaching me rapier tomorrow. Maybe I can move. Littenby isn&#8216;t far away. I could probably start a new life there.</p>
      <p>I realize now you may not know who Idin is, and I feel bad for mentioning him. He&#8216;s a guard…captain, I assume. I haven&#8216;t had a good look at his uniform because I walk away as quickly as I can whenever I see him. He&#8216;s the one that found me and kept me alive on that day you and I met. I&#8216;m grateful, but that doesn&#8216;t mean I want to see him. He knows too much about me, he could arrest me at any time, and it&#8216;s weird. I&#8216;m not sure if seeing him at work is any worse than seeing him at home, though. He&#8216;s come by a couple times, and we sometimes talk. I don&#8216;t know what he wants from me, but I&#8216;ve already thanked him a thousand times, so I think I&#8216;ve fulfilled my social duty.</p>
      <p>That&#8216;s all, so YOU have to tell me everything now. Is there an actual Rosemund? Is Davian finally gone for good? Did you fight any magical creatures along the way? Do dragons actually exist?</p>
